## Overview
This docker-compose will build multiple docker containers as part of a server group to host REDCap on your local computer/server.
The build consists of:
 * The official PHP-Apache docker image (Currently version 7.3)
 * The official MySql docker image (currently version 5.7)
 * A basic alpine-based MailHog image (for capturing outbound emails from REDCap for your review)
 * A basic alpine-based cron image (for running the REDCap cron and handling log rotation)
 * (optional) The official PhpMyAdmin web-based mysql tool for managing the database.
   * You can comment this out or stop the service after startup (see FAQ)  

The big advantage of this docker-based method is you can easily upgrade database versions, php versions, and see how 
these changes might affect your projects or custom code.  It also provides a nice mechanism for you and your development
team to work in identical environments for consistency.

### Docker-Compose Design
This docker-compose script relies on a number of underlying images which are build or pulled to build your containers
* docker-cron (built from Dockerfile)
* docker-mailhog (built from Dockerfile)
* docker-web (build from Dockerfile)
* mysql image (pulled as official image)
* phpmyadmin image (pulled as official image)

Those images that use Dockerfiles can be modified by tweaking the Dockerfile or scripts in each folder.  You must
rebuild the container after modifying the Dockerfile.

Many of these docker containers are further customized through a series of startup scripts.  The basic Docker-compose
is a LAMP stack that could be used for any project.  However, the `redcap-overrides` and Docker-compose file provides
a mechanism to add addition REDCap-specific customizations.

For example, `docker-web/container-config/php/70-sendmail_path` sets up a generic msmtp mail service, but `redcap-overrides/web/php` sets up 
typical REDCap php settings.  It should be possible to reuse this framework to create other version, such as SAML-enabled, or open-IDC
containers for REDCap testing and production.

## Configuration
1. Install docker on your machine.
   * Docker now requires that you create a user account.  Register.
   * [Download the latest version of docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) desktop for your platform:
     * For PC, I had to install the latest WSL2 Linux kernel update package and restart but gui walks you through the process.  Also, upon launching
     VS Code, I installed the WSL extension.
   * Optional: You might also consider installing a docker GUI such as [Kitematic](https://kitematic.com/)
1. Download a zip of this repository [andy123/redcap-docker-compose](https://github.com/123andy/redcap-docker-compose) 
   to your computer.  If you plan on contributing to the project, you may instead want to fork it and then clone your fork.
   * A zip file is available here: [zip download](https://github.com/123andy/redcap-docker-compose/archive/master.zip)
   * Unzip this into a good place on your computer (e.g. desktop or documents)
      * On my Mac, I put it in a folder called 'redcap' under my user directory `~/redcap/`
1. INSTALL A GOOD IDE.  This really makes things easier.  I can recommend:
   * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/),
   * [phpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/), 
   * and fancy editors like: [Atom](https://atom.io/), etc... )
1. From your IDE, open the folder where redcap-docker-compose was placed:
    ![Folder Tree](folder_tree.png)
1. Inside the `rdc` folder, find the `.env-example` file.  
   * If you do not see the `.env-example` file, you probably aren't using a real IDE.  In windows and MAC, dot-files are hidden by default unless you tell it to show them.
1. Copy the `.env-example` file to `.env`.
1. Review the contents of the `.env` file, **REALLY**.  This is where the majority of configuration changes are made.  You should take a glance through so you understand what you can change.
   * If you are on a MAC, make sure you open your terminal and run `id` to get your USER ID.  Typically it will be 501-505 depending on how many users you have on your MAC.  Make sure this value matches to reduce issues with file permissions in your mapped WEB directory.
   * If you are not running another local web-server or mysql server, your ports should be open.  Otherwise, you may have to change some of the ports for WEB or MYSQL services.  You will get errors when building if the ports are 
   being used.
     * On a MAC, you can test if your ports are open (default 80 for web and 3386 for mysql) with:
     ```
     $ lsof -i tcp:80
     $ lsof -i tcp:3386
     ```
     If you get nothing back, they are free.  Otherwise you can change the ports in your `.env` file.
1. Let's get ready to rumble.  After you have reviewed your `.env` we are ready to fire things up.  The first time it may take a while as it has to download some of the container images from docker hub.
   * Bring up the container
        ```
        $ cd rdc
        $ docker-compose up -d
        ```
   * You can tail the logs with
        ```
        $ docker-compose logs -f
        ```
1. Hopefully you can now reach your server at `http://localhost` or `http://127.0.0.1`
   * I prefer to access my 'local' redcap with a custom domain of 'redcap.local'.  
     * MAC Instructions: edit my /etc/hosts and append `redcap.local` after localhost:
       ```
       127.0.0.1       localhost redcap.local
       ```
       Then I access the server at http://redcap.local
     * PC Instructions: edit `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` and make the same change as above.  You will have to be an administrator to save the file (or VS Code helps you)
1. You need a copy of the REDCap Installer.
   * If you are a member of the REDCap Consortium Community, you can:
      1. [Download](https://community.projectredcap.org/page/download.html) the latest full installer as a zip file.
      2. Alternately, if you know your community username and password, there is a built-in setup tool that can complete
      the installation for you.
        * You can find your community username under your community profile (typically something like jane.b.doe)
   * If you do not have an access code for the Community Consortium, you can ask your local site's REDCap administrator
   to provide you with a copy of the latest FULL ZIP installer (provide the instructions above).  
      * If your institution has a license you should be able to install a local development version under that license
      * If you represent your institution, you can request a community account [here](https://community.projectredcap.org/articles/26/getting-started-introduction-learning-the-basics.html)
   * If you are not affiliated with an institution that has a license with REDCap, you CANNOT access the source code and will be unable to use this tool.  You can contact REDCap to request a license [here](https://project-redcap.org). 
1. Configure REDCap
   * At this point, we assume that you have a running set of containers.  Use the REDCap Setup tool to complete your
    installation.  Please note that you DO NOT need to create a new database user as the `.env` and setup scripts for
    MySql have already done so.  You can find the usernames and passwords in the `.env` file.


### X-Debug Configuration (optional for PHPStorm)
X-Debug allows you to insert breakpoints in your php code and evaluate variables from the server in your IDE.  Directions
for using PhpStorm are provided here.  Basically, you configure an xdebug server on PhpStorm.
1. After your docker server is up and running, open your project folder in PhpStorm (e.g. `~/redcap/`)
1. In PhpStorm, goto `preferences -> Languages & Frameworks -> PHP -> Server` and create new server.
   1. Name the server 'localhost-xdebug-server' - this name matches 
   1. Set the hostname to be 'localhost' and leave the port at '80'
   1. Check the "Use Path Mapping" option and find the redcap-docker-compose file.
      * On the left side, set the path of your codebase (e.g. `~/redcap/www`)
      * On the right side under `Absolute path on the server` enter in the value `/var/www/html`
1. After creating the server on PHPStorm go to `Run -> Edit Configuration`.  Create new "PHP Remote Debug" configuration.
   1. Make sure to check `Filter debug connection by IDE Key`. 
   1. Then select `localhost-xdebug-server` for server and type `PHPSTORM` for IDE Key.
   1. You can validate your configuration by clicking on Validate under Pre-Configuration. You need to specify your www directory in the 'validation script' directory, e.g. /Users/andy/redcap-docker-compose/www . 
1. Finally you need to install the [PhpDebug Browser debugger extension](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/browser-debugging-extensions.html)
To debug, launch the debug configuration by clicking the green bug icon, then click the "start listening for Php debug connections" icon. Then browse to the page you want to debug. 


## FAQ and Other Information

### How do I prevent SMS messages from going out?
If you do not want your local instance to be able to send text messages, you can:
  * uncomment the block of code in the web container (remove the `#`)
    ```
    #    extra_hosts:
    #      - "api.twilio.com:127.0.0.1"
    #      - "www.twilio.com:127.0.0.1"
    #      - "taskrouter.twilio.com:127.0.0.1"
    #      - "lookups.twilio.com:127.0.0.1"
    #      - "event-bridge.twilio.com:127.0.0.1"
    ```
  * Then restart the web container with `docker-compose up -d --no-deps --build web`

### How do I stop phpMyAdmin
If you have another mysql admin tool you'd prefer to use, you can prevent your docker-compose from instantiating the
phpMyAdmin container.  Either:
* After startup (e.g. `docker-compose up -d`) you could run `docker-compose stop phpmyadmin`
* Alternately, you can comment out the phpmyadmin section of the `docker-compose.yml` file with `#` before each line.

### Connecting to the database
There are at least three ways to connect to your database:
1. You can connect to the database from your client using any database tool (dataGrip, phpWorkbench, etc).  The default
 port is 3306 but you can change this in the `.env` file.
1. You have phpMyAdmin running inside this service - simply visit [http://localhost/phpmyadmin/](http://localhost/phpmyadmin/)
   * Note that the trailing slash is required!
1. You can connect to the database from the command line as illustrated in the example below:
```
$ docker-compose exec db mysql -u redcap -predcap123
redcap-docker-compose$ docker-compose exec db mysql -u redcap -predcap123
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Server version: 5.7.23-log MySQL Community Server (GPL)

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

mysql> 
```


### Local URLS
* You can access your webroot at [http://localhost](http://localhost/) or [http://127.0.0.1](http://127.0.0.1/)
   * If this isn't working, see FAQ below
* You can access your mailhog at [http://localhost/mailhog/](http://localhost/mailhog/)
   * (don't forget the trailing slash)
* You can access your phpMyAdmin at [http://localhost/phpmyadmin/](http://localhost/phpmyadmin/)
   * (don't forget the trailing slash)


### Logging
* Some logs (like apache access and cron) are passed through to the docker runtime and can be viewed by calling 
`docker-compose logs` or can be viewed using a gui tool.  
* Other log files (like mysql slow queries and php_errors.log) are mapped through to a log volume on your computer for
easy monitoring using tools like notepad++ (pc), console (mac), or just `tail -f *` from the terminal.
* Custom application logs should be written to `/var/log/redcap` inside the web image that maps to the `$LOG_DIR` 
as configured in the `.env` file.
* Log rotation can be configured so your log files don't grow too large - see `redcap-overrides/cron/logrotate` for an example. 



### I can't access my server at http://localhost even though docker is running!
   * On some macs, we've seen issues with using the name `localhost`.  If you are unable to resolve a webpage
     with [http://localhost/](http://localhost) you can try [http://127.0.0.1](http://127.0.0.1).
     * On my mac, I have edit the local hosts file and created an entry called `redcap.local`.  To do this, type
       `sudo open -e /etc/hosts` and make the line for 127.0.0.1 look like: 
       ```127.0.0.1       localhost redcap.local```
       You should now be able to open up your localhost docker with http://redcap.local

### How do I make a custom localhost alias?
I prefer to use http://redcap.local for my local server.  On my MAC, I accomplish this by editing my hosts file.
```
$ cat /etc/hosts
...
127.0.0.1       localhost
...
```
I then modify this to read as:
```
127.0.0.1       localhost redcap.local
```

### Useful Docker-compose Commands
Please note that **all commands** must be run from the root directory where the `docker-compose.yaml` file is 
located (unless you specify additional parameters).  

   * `docker-compose up -d` - this will run and detach form the containers leaving them to run in the background.  
   This is the most common way I run these containers.  You can view the status and logs from other `docker-compose`
   commands or from the GUI of docker-compose tools like [Kitematic](https://kitematic.com/)
   * `docker-compose up` - this will run the containers in the current window.  If you close your window the containers
     will be stopped.  I sometimes do this the first time.
   * `docker-compose up -d --force-recreate` - This should be run if you modify the .env file or other custom override
     files and need those changes to be incorporated into the containers -- otherwise your changes will not appear in the
     running images.
   * `docker-compose up -d --no-deps --build <CONTAINER_NAME>` - If you just want to rebuild one container and not all
     of them. Valid names are `web`, `db`, `cron`, `mailhog`, `phpmyadmin` and `startup`)
   * `docker-compose stop` - this will stop the docker process (which would be good to do if you want to save battery)
   * `docker-compose down` - this will stop **and remove** the containers - meaning the next time you call up they will be 
     recreated (this is similar to the --force-recreate tag)
   * `docker-compose down -v` - this will stop and remove the containers *along with their internal volumes*.  For
     example, if you call this any saved email messages from mailhub would be removed.
   * `docker ps` - shows you all running containers - see the docker command reference
   * `docker ps -a` - shows you all running *and stopped* containers.


### Can I change the location of my webroot files?
By default, this package uses the www folder in the parent directory to the rdc folder.  You can, however, easily point
to a different location by changing the `WEBROOT_DIR` in the `.env` file and re-starting with `docker-compose up -d`

I have seen file permission issues at times when mapping local directories to the docker containers.  This is the point
of specifying the `APACHE_RUN_USER_ID` on MACs.


### Can I run more than one instance of REDCap-Docker-Compose at the same time?
Yes you can, but you want to make sure they don't clobber each other.  The safe way to do this is to make a complete copy of the redcap-docker-compose folder and then modify the `rdc/.env` file. Each version of the rdc folder must have a different value in the `DOCKER_PREFIX` variable of the `.env` file.  This will ensure
that the networks and volumes are uniquely named and do not collide.  If you want to run both instances simultaneously
you will have to change the ports on one so they are unique, such as 81 for web and 3387 for database.
As of this writing, these ports are defined in .env

```
WEB_PORT=80
MYSQL_PORT=3306
PHPMYADMIN_PORT=8080
MAILHOG_PORT=8025
```

When you go to pick port numbers, it is generally safest to pick from the range 1024 - 65535. Each of the values selected for these port numbers needs to be unique to across the running instances.

If you want to run a lot of instances at once, consider a pattern for setting the ports wherein the REDCap version forms the last 3 or 4 digits of the port number while the first digit indicates which of the 4 assignments is which. You could work the `DOCKER_PREFIX` into the pattern as well. e.g., REDCap 9.4.2 would get these parameters:

```
DOCKER_PREFIX=rc942
WEB_PORT=1942
MYSQL_PORT=2942
PHPMYADMIN_PORT=3942
MAILHOG_PORT=4942
```

You can paste a block of parameters like this at the end of the .env file to override all of the parameters above.

Once you have changed the WEB_PORT to something other than 80, you'll need to append a ":" and the port number to "localhost" in all of URLs examples in this document that use no port number. e.g. Using the above port example, the installation step would require you to visit `http://localhost:1942/`. The proxy service in the web container would make phpMyAdmin accessible at http://localhost:1942/phpmyadmin/, but it's also accessible at http://localhost:3942 because of the port definition above. Use whichever method works best for you.


### Can you explain how I would change the PHP version?
Sure.  Say you want to test out a new version of PHP and see if your External Module will continue to run. 

1. The quick way:
   * Modify the `Dockerfile` in `docker-web` and change the `FROM: php:7.3-apache` to the version you
want to run.  You can see a list of options here: [docker php](https://hub.docker.com/_/php?tab=tags&page=1&name=-apache)
   * Execute this one statement from the `rdc` directory in your terminal (assuming you're already running):
   
     `docker-compose up -d --no-deps --build web`
1. Alternately, you can stop ALL your services, make changes, and restart.  This would go something like:
   * Stop your Docker-compose by opening a terminal in the `rdc` folder and running `docker-compose stop`.
   * Modify the `docker-web/Dockerfile` or other changes
   * Rebuild the modified containers by running `docker-compose build <<CONTAINER NAME>>`
   * Restart all of the containers with `docker-compose up -d`

### Shutting down
You can shut down your servers by pressing ctrl-c in the window where you ran `docker-compose up`.  After a few seconds
 it should report all are off.

```
^CGracefully stopping... (press Ctrl+C again to force)
Stopping redcap ... done
Stopping mailhog ... done
```

This stops your running containers but does not delete them.  They are still there on your machine and will be 
restarted when you run `docker-compose up` again.  You can remove them (but not the volumes) with `docker-compose rm`.
Try restarting again with `docker-compose up -d` - it should be MUCH faster after the initial load.  Adding the `-d` means
detached so you can close your terminal window and the service will continue to run.


### Logging into the server
To get a bash shell as root in the redcap server, you can run:
```
$ docker-compose exec web /bin/bash
root@5af71d765e77:/# 

# become the apache user instead of root to avoid file permission issues
root@5af71d765e77:/# sudo www-data
www-data@5af71d765e77:~/html$

# Insert a file into the /var/www/html directory to test that it is syncing with my local www folder
www-data@5af71d765e77:~/html$ echo "Hello" > /var/www/html/test.html

# Look at my logs, which should match my log folder on my laptop
www-data@5af71d765e77:~/html$ ls -la /var/log/redcap/

# All done
www-data@5af71d765e77:~/html$ exit
root@5af71d765e77:/# exit
```
Keep in mind any changes you make will be transitory and lost if you ever recreate the container


### How can I see what's running?
The command `docker ps` shows what containers are running.  If your server is up, they will appear here.
The command `docker ps -a` shows all containers regardless of run state.

### If I remove my docker container will I loose my database?
No, by default the database is stored in a docker volume.  You can see the docker volumes with:
```
andy123  redcap-docker-compose  rdc $ docker volume ls
DRIVER              VOLUME NAME
local               redcap_logs-volume
local               redcap_mailhog-volume
local               redcap_mysql-volume

# Delete a volume (such as your mysql database)
andy123  redcap-docker-compose  rdc $ docker volume rm redcap_mysql-volume
```
If you remove a container, by default it DOES NOT remove the volumes.  

### How can I REALLY delete everything?
See the question above -- basically the volumes that docker-compose creates are normally not deleted.  To really clean
out and restart your docker-compose, you may have to remove them all.  You can also remove the network with the
equivalent `docker network ls` and `docker network rm redcap_network`

### How can I switch mysql versions?  For example, go from mySql 5.7 to mySql 8.0?
This docker-compose has been tested to work with mySql 8.  To make the switch you are going to have to regenerate your
mysql database and volume.  So, follow these steps:
1. Make a backup of your local mysql database.  This is most easily done using phpmyadmin.
   1. Goto http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ (if you don't have phpmyadmin running, make sure it isn't disabled in your
  docker-compose.yml file.
   1. Select Export -> Custom -> select redcap -> set compression to gzip -> and press go!
1. Stop your database container.
   ```
   $ docker-compose stop db
   ```
1. Delete the docker volume that contains your actual database data
   ```
   $ docker volume ls
   // Look for the volume like redcap-mysql_volume
   $ docker volume rm redcap-mysql_volume
   ```
1. Modify the version of mySql you want to run.  Goto the mysql docker page: https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql and pick a
version, something like `8.0`
1. Open the `docker-mysql/Dockerfile` in the `rdc` directory and change the `FROM mysql:5.7` to your new version
   ```
   FROM mysql:8.0
   #FROM mysql:5.7
   ```
1. Now rebuild your mysql image
   ```shell script
   $ docker-compose build db
   ```
1. Now run it
   ```shell script
   $ docker-compose up db -d
   // Follow the logs if you like...
   $ docker-compose logs -f
   ```
1. Restore your backup using phpmyadmin.  Open http://localhost/phpmyadmin/  Choose IMPORT and then `Choose File` to
select your redcap.sql.gz from step 1.

At this point you should be running your dev server on a new version of mySql.  You can use the same process to change
your database version anytime.

1. How can I use Docker to run various commands against my database?
   ```shell script
   # SEE THE NETWORK FOR YOUR DOCKER-COMPOSE CONTAINERS (e.g. rdc_default)
   docker network list

   # BASIC TEST OF CONNECTION
   docker run --rm \
     --network=rdc_default \
     imega/mysql-client \
     mysql --host=db --user=root --password=root --execute='show databases;'

   # GET A SHELL
   docker run -it \
     --network=rdc_default \
     --volume $(pwd):/mysqldump \
     imega/mysql-client \
     /bin/sh

   # GET A MYSQL SHELL
   docker run -it \
     --network=rdc_default \
     --volume $(pwd):/mysqldump \
     imega/mysql-client \
     mysql --host=db --user=root --password=root

   # GET A MYSQL DUMP
   docker run --rm \
     --network=rdc_default \
     --volume $(pwd):/mysqldump \
     imega/mysql-client \
     /bin/sh -c "mysqldump --host=db --user=root --password=root redcap > /mysqldump/redcap_backup.sql"

   # GET A MYSQL DUMP GZIPPED (doing the sh -c seemed necessary as volume wasn't otherwise immediately ready?)
   docker run --rm \
     --network=rdc_default \
     --volume $(pwd):/mysqldump \
     imega/mysql-client \
     /bin/sh -c "mysqldump --host=db --user=root --password=root redcap | gzip > /mysqldump/redcap_backup.sql.gz"

   # RESTORE A MYSQL DUMP FROM sql.gz FILE
   docker run -it \
     --network=rdc_default \
     --volume $(pwd):/mysqldump \
     imega/mysql-client \
     /bin/sh -c "mysql --host=db --user=root --password=root --execute 'create database if not exists new_db'; gunzip < /mysqldump/redcap_backup.sql.gz | mysql --host=db --user=root --password=root new_db"
   ```
