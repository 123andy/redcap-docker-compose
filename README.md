## About
This repo is designed to build a local development instance of REDCap on your laptop.  It also includes some aids 
to try and facilitate a rapid setup of REDCap using either your consortium credentials or a complete installer you 
receive from a teammate at your institution.

This is intended to be one of the fastest and easiest ways to create a local development instance of REDCap on your 
computer or test server.

This is not intended to be used as a production server, although we do run something pretty similar here at Stanford.
Should you want to run this as production, be sure to edit the `redcap.ini` file in the `override-web/php` folder
to have production-ready php settings.

## Features
 * Mailhog to capture outbound email for review
 * X-Debug support for detailed server-side inspection
 * PhpMyAdmin support for easy database maintenance / backups / restores
 * Easy to modify php-version or mysql-version and rebuild your environment in minutes

## Quick-Start
 * Install Docker Community Edition (requires docker account which is free)
 * [Download this repository](https://github.com/123andy/redcap-docker-compose/archive/master.zip) and unzip it to your computer
 * Open your download directory using a good IDE (
 [phpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/), 
 [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/),
 [Atom](https://atom.io/), etc... )
 * Edit the `.env` file located in the `rdc` folder review the contents, making changes as necessary.
 * Once `.env` file settings are correct, from the `rdc` folder type `docker-compose up -d`
 * Open your web browser and goto `http://localhost` (or, in some cases with macs `http://127.0.0.1`) and follow
  directions for further installation -> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UsQmK1Jw0L_wD3UcjlQo_6iDjXadLeFHT427e50XR8M/edit
